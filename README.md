# Transportation Services Financial Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes financial and performance metrics of various transportation services over multiple fiscal years. The focus is on revenue, expenditures, net revenue, year-over-year (YoY) variances, and customer satisfaction to identify key insights and recommend strategic improvements.

## Key Findings

### Revenue vs. Expenditures
- A bar plot comparing revenues and expenditures across different transportation services highlights operational inefficiencies.
- Some services consistently operate at a loss, indicating a need for cost optimization or investment shifts.

### Net Revenue Trends
- Net revenue fluctuates over fiscal years, with some services experiencing consistent growth while others decline.
- Further analysis is required to assess operational efficiencies and areas for improvement.

### Customer Satisfaction
- A correlation analysis indicates a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and revenue.
- Enhancing service quality could lead to increased customer retention and financial growth.

### Year-over-Year (YoY) Variance
- Significant variations in revenue and expenditures suggest volatility in financial performance.
- Possible reasons include demand fluctuations, economic conditions, and policy changes.

## Recommendations
1. **Cost Control Measures**: Evaluate services with high expenditures and low revenue for potential budget cuts or efficiency improvements.
2. **Customer Experience Investments**: Improve service quality to drive customer satisfaction and increase revenue.
3. **Strategic Budget Allocation**: Target investments in services showing consistent net revenue growth to maximize financial returns.
